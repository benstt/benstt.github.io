  "articleBody": "You’re in the middle of deciding what do you want to do. You go to GitHub, click ’explore’ and see so many open-source projects in so many programming languages. You say to yourself ‘agh, I really want to do stuff like that some day’, so you decide that you’re going to start a side project, right away. All these options, all these programming languages, all this topics, you want to learn everything! Where do we start!?\nHaving so many options is definitely a double-edged sword. I often find myself either wanting to learn a language or wanting to do X thing. Be it to build a DNS server in Rust, a game with C++, my own Docker in Go or a compiler in Haskell. How great, fun stuff! With the power of internet and open-source information of nowadays, this isn’t difficult to do. A simple Google or GitHub search and you’re up and ready! But the thing is, you have to decide on what are you going to do.\nSay you finally decide on learning about databases with C. You’ve got the basics and found a nice blog post on creating a SQLite clone from scratch. You begin to read and immediately lose interest as it’s like just copying code and seeing that you’re not actually learning anything. Reading a bunch of words about parsers and tokenizers from a page on the internet doesn’t help you understand a lot about the subject. That happened to me last week. I said to myself “I’m going to finish that project!” … but just an hour later I was bored as hell.\nMaybe I’m more of a research-and-break guy. All of my side projects I’ve made began by just getting ideas on things I want to do and actually start coding something. No matter what it is, you type stuff, search documentation, and that slowly builds into a snowball. After an hour you realize you’ve been programming for 6 hours. This, of course, works. Learning by doing is the #1 way to learn something. Deciding on something is the difficult part.\nSo I’ve decided I’m going to build a simple web server to host my blog. My own stuff, where I’ll do everything from scratch by myself and not following any tutorial.\nMotivation The mix between university and work lets me learn a lot of stuff, and specially fun stuff. Docker, K8S, AWS, Nginx, Django, Cloud and security stuff and most importantly, the ability to document things and getting them done.\nRecently I have been watching a lot of YouTube, specially videos from Pelado Nerd, an Argentinian youtuber and SRE. Anything you want to learn about Cloud and Operations, he probably has a video on it. Also, there’s one Twitch streamer that I found in the last weeks, rwxrob. It quickly became my favourite streamer as watching their streams is like learning by breathing. Seeing stuff about Docker, Kubernetes, Golang in such a deep way is awesome, while also creating a really nice community of cloud, linux, open-source-driven people. I’ve asked my teachers at university for some advice on what could I do with my love to Software Engineering and the desire to learn about Operating Systems. They told me I could see if DevOps is the right thing for me, so I’m giving it a try by creating this web server entirely from scratch with the things I have learned these past months, and I’m willing to even learn a lot more.\nThe plan In order to create it I’ll need a couple of things:\nA way to build my own infrastructure and setup a server A way to manage my web resources (just a little, by creating custom URLs to sections of the web) A way to convert Markdown into HTML (all of my blog posts will be written entirely in .md files) A nice looking web page (god I hate front-end webdev, but whatever) Set up a TLS certificate for the web I’ll begin by creating some general visual structure of what my blog will look like. Not a lot of fancy stuff, just a basic way to display these words in a page with some styling. That could probably be done by a static generator site like Hugo or Jekyll, but how will I learn then? Then it’s about creating a very simple Django or Gin backend stuff. The very basics to just show URLs, like myweb.com/posts/.\nOnce that everything is done, that both front-end and back-end is working with a nice way to convert .md files to plain HTML, I’ll setup an Nginx web server running on-prem with TLS certification. This step will probably be the most difficult one as I don’t really have a lot of experience building infrastructure this way. But hell, it’ll be fun.\nThe journey begins So, to sum up. I’ll be doing a lot of stuff from scratch when I could simply use tools on the internet that do the job for me, like hosting on github pages, using a static site generator or letting AWS handle all of the infrastructure. But in that case I wouldn’t be learning anything. That’ll be like just reading a tutorial on how to create X thing, and we’re back to the conflict! Of course, once I have learned how to do all of this stuff myself, in a next ocassion I’ll (probably) just use the pre-written tools.\nIt’s a long journey. But I will stick to the end. Hopefully this post ends up online :)\n",
