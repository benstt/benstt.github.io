      <description>In my first blog post, Creating a basic on-prem personal blog, I noted what was the plan on building this website. I talked about how I was going to make everything from scratch, including the look of the page, its backend and a server to host it at home.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of deciding what do you want to do. You go to GitHub, click &amp;rsquo;explore&amp;rsquo; and see so many open-source projects in so many programming languages. You say to yourself &amp;lsquo;agh, I really want to do stuff like that some day&amp;rsquo;, so you decide that you&amp;rsquo;re going to start a side project, right away. All these options, all these programming languages, all this topics, you want to learn everything!</description>
